->A heap data structure is a complete binary tree
->There are two types of heap data structures
       1.Min heap
       2.Max heap

       Min heap :- Its parent node is always less than their child node
       Max heap :- Its parent node is always greater than their child node

->Operations in heap data structure
                
             Heapify :-  process of creating a heap from an array
             Insertion :- process of inserting an element into a heap. Time complexity O(log N)
             Deletion :- process of deleting the highest priority node(top element) and then organizing and returing the element. Time Complexity O(log N)
             Peek :- to check the highest priority element of the heap (max and min for max and min heap)
