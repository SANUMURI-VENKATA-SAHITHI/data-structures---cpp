->A heap data structure is a complete binary tree
->There are two types of heap data structures
       1.Min heap
       2.Max heap

       Min heap :- Its parent node is always less than their child node
       Max heap :- Its parent node is always greater than their child node

->Operations in heap data structure
                
             Heapify :-  process of creating a heap from an array
             Insertion :-
